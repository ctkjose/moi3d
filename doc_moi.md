You can run a command in the small box at the bottom of the window showing the coordinates. Erase the contents, type the name of a command and press enter to execute the command.

Select object, hit Tab abd type "Move" then pick point of object (Any point for that matter. Much more powerful and precise!) then hit tab and "All current coords are there" just change what you like and hit enter.

I think what you miss is an additional UI popup that houses all this functionality.

In your example you show the input field to be "131.25 403.02 312.45". You can change "any" of those 3 numbers that you like! Do you object that there are not seperate fields for each number?

Also, with the Ui you describe, how would you move this point and attach it to the circle?
