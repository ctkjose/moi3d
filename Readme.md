# Plugin SDK

PluginSDK is a my attempt to improve MoI's [API](doc_api.md) to make extending MoI even easier. Its a javascript layer/api to complement MoI's [API](doc_api.md) for know I opted to do add a parallel plugin structure.

This still in early stages building the scaffolding and learning the internals of the API.
